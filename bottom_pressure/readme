Python code used to calculate bottom pressure anomaly from LiveOcean, and compare it with obs.

Three model versions being examined:

• cas7_t0_x4b: current LiveOcean
• cas6_v0_live: previous LiveOcean, likely being used to get the old model-data bottom pressure comparison
• or2_t0_x0: a small domain model in the offshore of Oregon Coast.

Hourly extractions at the four observation stations (CP01, CP015, CP02, and CP03) from the three models can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yp3ApGdkc3yrPgH4C9ow1VGw2WnoKNtF?usp=sharing
